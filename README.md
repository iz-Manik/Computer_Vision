# Legaleon

**Legaleon** is an autonomous AI agent for decentralized legal assistance in the Web3 space. It empowers users to easily navigate the complexities of smart contracts and blockchain agreements, ensuring transparency, privacy, and security by leveraging the Sonic blockchain ecosystem.

## Goal

Build an AI-powered agent that provides legal assistance related to Web3. **Legaleon** will help users:
- Interpret smart contracts,
- Highlight potential legal risks,
- Generate basic legal documents,
- Offer consultations on Web3-related legal matters.

## Features

### 1. **Legal Document Interpretation**
   - Provide simplified, easy-to-understand explanations of complex legal terms and clauses in user-uploaded documents.
   - Ensure users can quickly grasp the meaning and implications of the legal language involved.

### 2. **Smart Contract Risk Identification**
   - Analyze user-submitted smart contracts and identify potential risks or vulnerabilities (e.g., common attacks like reentrancy, missing clauses, unclear terms).
   - Provide actionable feedback to enhance contract security and effectiveness.

### 3. **Document Generation**
   - Allow users to generate simple legal documents such as:
     - Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs),
     - Service agreements,
     - Basic partnership contracts.
   - Users can specify their requirements, and the AI will generate appropriate legal templates.

### 4. **Consultation**
   - Offer basic legal consultations about Web3 transactions or actions, such as:
     - Token issuance and related regulations,
     - DeFi involvement and its legal landscape,
     - NFT creation and ownership rights.
   - This feature will help users understand the legal implications of their Web3 activities.

## Blockchain Integration

**Legaleon** leverages the **Sonic blockchain** to ensure that all legal documents and consultations are stored securely and transparently:
- **Smart contracts** for document signing and storage on the blockchain.
- **Decentralized storage** of important legal information.
- Immutable audit trails for document creation and modification.

## Technologies Used

- **AI Model**: Powered by NLP and machine learning models for legal document interpretation and consultation.
- **Sonic Blockchain**: For decentralized storage, smart contracts, and transparent document signing.
- **Frontend**: React-based web interface for interacting with the AI agent and managing documents.
- **Backend**: Python for AI and legal document analysis, integrated with Sonic's blockchain for storage and smart contract deployment.

## How It Works

1. **Step 1: Upload or Input Contract/Agreement**
   - Users upload their smart contract or type a legal query into the chatbot.
   
2. **Step 2: AI Analysis and Advice**
   - The AI interprets the document and provides plain-language explanations for each clause.
   - If the document is a smart contract, it scans for potential risks and suggests improvements.
   
3. **Step 3: Document Modification**
   - The AI suggests edits, and users approve or adjust the proposed changes.
   
4. **Step 4: Document Signing and Storage**
   - After finalizing the document, users sign it digitally, and it is stored securely on the Sonic blockchain.

5. **Step 5: Record Keeping**
   - The interaction is logged on the blockchain for transparent tracking of document creation, modification, and signing.
